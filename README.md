# 🎓 Impact of Social Media on Student Productivity  
### An Interactive Data Analysis & Simulation Project

This project investigates how daily social media usage affects study hours, academic performance, and sleep patterns among students.  
Using Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning models, the app provides:

- 📊 Dynamic visualizations  
- 🤖 Predictive modelling (Linear Regression & Random Forest)  
- 🎛️ Interactive simulator to test screen-time reduction scenarios  
- 🧪 Live data entry for survey demonstrations  
- 📥 Downloadable datasets and charts  
- 🌐 Optional online deployment for easy teacher access
